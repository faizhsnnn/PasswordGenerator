# 🔐 PyPassword Generator

PyPassword Generator is a simple yet powerful Python project that creates strong, secure, and random passwords based on user preferences.  
It’s designed to help users understand Python fundamentals like loops, lists, and the `random` module — while producing a practical, real-world utility.

## 🧠 How It Works

The program:
1. Prompts the user to input:
   - Number of letters (a–z, A–Z)
   - Number of symbols (!, @, #, etc.)
   - Number of digits (0–9)
2. Randomly selects characters from each category.
3. Shuffles them for enhanced randomness.
4. Displays the final secure password.

## 💻 Example Output

```bash 
Welcome to PyPassword Generator!
How many letters would you like in your password?
8
How many symbols would you like in your password?
3
How many numbers would you like in your password?
4
Your password is: tH@3a!xF8Zc$L
